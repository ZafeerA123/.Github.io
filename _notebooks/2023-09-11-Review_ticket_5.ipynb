    "This code listens for certain key clicks. This code gives function to the 0-9 keys, the decimal, and backspace. The decimal and number keys are the easiest because you just need to lsiten for it and then input it into the calculator. The backspace is harder because it requires you to give the key a function that isn't as straight forward as numbers."
