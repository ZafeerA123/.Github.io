## JavaScript Overview:
JavaScript enables interactivity, adding functionality, and manipulating web page content.
It is supported by all major web browsers.
JavaScript is an event-driven language, responding to user actions and events.
It's essential for building modern web applications, such as web games, dynamic web pages, and web-based tools.

## Front-End JavaScript:

Front-end JavaScript is executed in the user's web browser.
It is used to enhance the user interface and user experience of a web page.
It can be used to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) and create dynamic content.
## Back-End JavaScript:

Back-end JavaScript, using technologies like Node.js, allows you to run JavaScript on the server.
It's used to handle server-side tasks like data processing, file operations, and handling API requests.

## Examples
Variables and Data Types: 
```javascript
let, const, var, data types (e.g., strings, numbers, booleans).
```
Functions: Declaring and calling functions.
Conditional Statements: if, else, switch.
Loops: for, while, do...while.
Arrays: Creating and manipulating arrays.
Objects: Creating and using objects.
Event Handling: Adding event listeners to HTML elements.
DOM Manipulation: Changing HTML content and attributes.
Error Handling: Handling errors with try...catch.
Classes: Object-oriented programming in JavaScript.
Modules: Importing and exporting code modules.
Events: Creating custom events.
Canvas: Drawing graphics on a web page.
Debugging: Using browser developer tools.
Animation: Creating animations using CSS and JavaScript.
Virtual DOM: Understanding frameworks like React.

## HTML Overview:

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a markup language for creating web pages.
It structures content on the web, defining elements such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, and forms.
HTML documents consist of nested elements enclosed in tags.
It is essential for building the structure and layout of web pages.
20 Important HTML Elements and Code Snippets:

<!DOCTYPE html>: Document type declaration.
<html>: The root element.
<head>: Contains metadata and links to external resources.
<title>: Sets the page title.
<meta>: Provides metadata about the document.
<link>: Links to external resources (CSS, icon, etc.).
<script>: Embeds or references JavaScript code.
<style>: Embeds CSS styles.
<div>: A generic container.
<p>: Defines a paragraph.
<h1> to <h6>: Headings.
<ul> and <ol>: Unordered and ordered lists.
<li>: List item.
<a>: Creates hyperlinks.
<img>: Embeds images.
<form>: Defines a form.
<input>: Input fields in forms.
<textarea>: Multiline text input.
<button>: A clickable button.
<iframe>: Embeds external content.

## Difference Between JavaScript and HTML:

JavaScript is a programming language used for adding functionality and interactivity to web pages. It runs in the browser (front end) and on the server (back end with Node.js).
HTML is a markup language used to structure and display content on web pages. It defines the page's layout and content but lacks the ability to perform logic or interactivity.
JavaScript and HTML work together: JavaScript enhances HTML by making web pages interactive and dynamic, while HTML defines the content and structure of those pages.
These code snippets and concepts cover essential aspects of JavaScript and HTML for web development. They can be used as building blocks for creating interactive and well-structured web applications.


## Objected Oriented Programming (simply explained)
In simple terms, OOP is like creating a set of Lego blocks. Each block is an object, and they can be connected to form complex structures. 

For example, consider a "Car" object. It has attributes (properties) such as color, speed, and size, and it has behaviors (methods) such as starting the engine, stopping, and accelerating. In OOP, you'd create a class called "Car" that defines these attributes and behaviors, and then create instances of this class to represent specific cars in your program.

OOP helps in organizing code, making it easier to manage, maintain, and extend, especially when dealing with complex systems or programs with many interacting parts.
