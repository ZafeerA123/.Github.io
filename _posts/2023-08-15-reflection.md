## Reflection
I started this class not even knowing what javascript and HTML was, and only knew a little bit of python. But over time, I figured out through the web programming basics quiz and through the different tech talks, what vscode to debugging is. One challenge I had this trimester was defenitley the inexperience our group had (besides Trystan) on how javascript worked, and the learning we got on the way. This included videos, and chatpgt that we read and used to try to figure out the code better. One key thing I learned is how console.log works, and how to debug errors and how to use it overall to improve your code. Overall, next trimester I want to get better at fluently writing javascript without depending on chatgpt as much, and I would like to focus on backend more.
