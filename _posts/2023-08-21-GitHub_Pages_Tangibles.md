### Important commands to remember:
ls: List files and directories in the current directory.

cd: Change the current working directory.

make: Build and manage projects using Makefiles.

clear: Clear the terminal screen.

touch: Create an empty file or update the timestamp of an existing file.

rm: Remove files and directories. Be careful, as it's a powerful command.

cp: Copy files and directories.

### Problems I faced
One problem I faced when starting out was when I was trying to type 'make' into vscode terminal, it wasn't working because I was in 'teacher', when I was supposed to be in student. My handsome partner Spencer asked if I was in the correct directory, and I wasn't quite sure what he meant, but then I realized that that the teacher repo and student repo aren't the same thing. 

This is Teacher Directory: 

```bash
default:~/vscode/teachers$▯
```

This is your Student Directory:
```bash
default:~/vscode/(Yourname).github.io$▯
```
