## What each Directory is 

Compsci.yml: Defining the structured data, in this case for our website the names of each header. For example [Time_Box_Page](https://zafeera123.github.io/ZafeerA123/compsci) or [Blogs](https://zafeera123.github.io/ZafeerA123/blogs) <br>

_Notebooks: These are jupyter notebooks, and are .ipynb files and allows for cell based programming, or interactble pages (Can use different types of code) <br>

_Posts: These are .md or markdown files, which are usually used for plain text. <br>

.github-> jekyll-gh-pages.yml: Used for hosting Jekyll-based websites on GitHub Pages. <br>

index.md: Used for creating the homepage of the website <br>





## Problem I faced
One problem I faced was when I published my page to github, my page was not loading. The message 

<![Local Image](./images/FILENOTFOUND.png)

 was showing up all the time, so what I did was go into the 

 ```python
_config.yml
```
and then I changed the url so that it was my github ID, and since I did this the page would recognize my id, and the page would then load. 

## Linux Commands to Remember
